> **Sequence:** A sequence could be used in a game where you move back and forth between locations. There could be a piece of text for the first time you arrive at a location, and a second one that is displayed whenever you return.
> 
> **Fallback Choice:** A fallback choice could be used in a situation where you want your reader to exhaust all given options before continuing. Perhaps your character is in a conversation, and there are several options about what to ask. You can loop the conversation back to the decision point after each option is finished, and then after the questions have all been exhausted the story will automatically move forwards.
> 
> **Stitches:** A good use for stitches is to block your interactive stories into "chapters." Within each chapter, you use stitches, and to move to a different chapter, divert to the next knot.
